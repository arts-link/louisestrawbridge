### Biography

Louise Strawbridge uses a wide range of materials and textures to explore the possibilities of
disturbing qualities in the commonplace. In her work, mystery is not to be solved but valued and
explored. She received a M.A. in Literature from The University of Chicago in 1971 and taught
English for many years. Making art became her full-time occupation when she moved to
London in 1998. She has lived in Philadelphia with her husband, David, since 2003. Her work
is in the permanent collection of Zhengzhou Art Museum, China.
